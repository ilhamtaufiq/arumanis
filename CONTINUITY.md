# Continuity Ledger

- Goal: Modify the Map Page to add kecamatan boundaries with filtering and click interaction.
- Constraints/Assumptions:
  - Project uses React 19, Vite, and react-leaflet.
  - GeoJSON files are located in `src/assets/geojson/kecamatan/`.
  - Use `id3203_cianjur.geojson` for the full boundary set.
  - Click interaction for popup and zoom.
- Key decisions:
  - Transitioned from prompt optimization to implementation.
  - Use `GeoJSON` component with `onEachFeature` for interaction.
  - Add a search/filter dropdown for kecamatan selection.
- State:
  - Done:
    - Optimized Map markers to show only the latest photo per project.
    - Integrated global fiscal year filter (`tahunAnggaran`) into Map data queries.
    - Standardized Map page layout using `Header` and `Main` components with `text-2xl` title.
    - Normalized District and Village names in GeoJSON and Database by removing spaces.
    - Implemented space-resilient matching logic in `MapPage.tsx`.
  - Now: Waiting for next task.
  - Next: UNCONFIRMED.
- Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed): None.
- Working set (files/ids/commands): [MapPage.tsx](file:///c:/laragon/www/bun/src/features/map/components/MapPage.tsx), [id3203_cianjur_simplified.geojson](file:///c:/laragon/www/bun/src/assets/geojson/kecamatan/id3203_cianjur_simplified.geojson).
