- Goal (incl. success criteria): Consolidate header, restrict search, move fiscal year, update READMEs, and optimize Docker builds.
- Constraints/Assumptions: Standard Laravel/React architecture. Bun usage for frontend. Alpine base for Docker efficiency.
- Key decisions: 
    - Moved `Search`, `ThemeToggle`, `NotificationBell`, `FiscalYearSelector`, and `HeaderUserNav` to the Header.
    - Restricted `Search` visibility and `FiscalYearSelector` editability to users with the 'admin' role.
    - Optimized `Dockerfile` builds for both projects with better layer caching and smaller base images.
- State:
  - Done: Header redesign, redundant component removal, admin-only search, fiscal year move and persistence, README updates, Docker optimizations.
  - Now: Final walkthrough and task completion.
  - Next: Awaiting next user objective.
- Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed): None.
- Working set (files/ids/commands): `header.tsx`, `fiscal-year-selector.tsx`, `app-settings-store.ts`, `Dockerfile`, `README.md`, `walkthrough.md`.
