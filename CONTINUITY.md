- Goal (incl. success criteria): Consolidate header elements, restrict global search to admins, and move fiscal year setting to header with per-user persistence.
- Constraints/Assumptions: Standard Laravel/React architecture. Access control via 'admin' role. Year persists in localStorage.
- Key decisions: 
    - Moved `Search`, `ThemeToggle`, `NotificationBell`, `FiscalYearSelector`, and `HeaderUserNav` to the Header.
    - Restricted `Search` visibility and `FiscalYearSelector` editability to users with the 'admin' role.
    - Implemented `app-settings-store` (Zustand) for client-side persistence of the active year, preventing cross-user conflicts.
    - Updated global hooks to use the client-side active year for data filtering.
- State:
  - Done: Header redesign, redundant component removal, admin-only search, fiscal year move and persistence.
  - Now: Final walkthrough and task completion.
  - Next: Awaiting next user objective.
- Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed): None.
- Working set (files/ids/commands): `header.tsx`, `fiscal-year-selector.tsx`, `app-settings-store.ts`, `use-app-settings.ts`, `walkthrough.md`.
