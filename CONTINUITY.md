- Goal (incl. success criteria): Consolidate header, restrict search, move fiscal year, update READMEs, optimize Docker builds, and implement a full Calendar feature using Shadcn UI.
- Constraints/Assumptions: Standard Laravel/React architecture. Bun usage. Shadcn UI for components.
- Key decisions: 
    - Moved header controls and restricted search/fiscal year editing to admins.
    - Optimized Dockerfiles for better caching and smaller sizes.
    - Implemented `tbl_events` and a custom Shadcn-based calendar for the feature.
    - Added `calendar` to menu permissions for role-based access.
- State:
  - Done: Header redesign, Docker optimizations, README update, Shadcn Calendar Refactor.
  - Now: Refactoring complete, verification finished.
  - Next: Awaiting next user objective.
- Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed): None.
- Working set (files/ids/commands): `CalendarView.tsx`, `EventDialog.tsx`, `EventController.php`, `api.php`, `walkthrough.md`.
